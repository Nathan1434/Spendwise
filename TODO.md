# SpendWise

Building an expense tracker is a great project to reinforce your React skills. Here are some key features you might want to consider adding to your expense tracker:

1. [ ] **Add Expense:**
       Allow users to add new expenses with details such as the amount, description, and category. Implement a form for users to input this information.

2. [ ] **Edit and Delete Expenses:**
       Provide functionality for users to edit and delete existing expenses. This involves implementing actions like "edit" and "delete" for each expense entry.

3. [ ] **Expense Categories:**
       Allow users to categorize their expenses (e.g., groceries, rent, utilities). This can be achieved by adding a category field to each expense entry.

4. [ ] **Date and Time Stamp:**
       Include a date and time stamp for each expense entry to track when the expense was incurred. You can use JavaScript's `Date` object for this purpose.

5. [ ] **Expense Total:**
       Display a running total of all expenses. This total should update dynamically as new expenses are added or existing ones are modified.

6. [ ] **Filter and Search:**
       Implement filtering and searching features to help users find specific expenses. This could include filtering by date range, category, or searching by keywords.

7. [ ] **Chart or Graph Visualization:**
       Provide a visual representation of the user's expenses, such as a pie chart or bar graph. You can use charting libraries like Chart.js or Victory for this.

8. [ ] **Budgeting Feature:**
       Allow users to set a monthly or weekly budget. Display a visual indicator of their spending relative to the budget, and notify them if they exceed it.

9. [ ] **Data Persistence:**
       Implement a way to store expense data persistently, either using local storage, a database (if you want to explore backend development), or a backend-as-a-service solution.

10. [ ] **Authentication (Optional):**
        If you want to add an extra layer of functionality, you can implement user authentication to allow multiple users to have their own expense tracking accounts.

11. [ ] **Responsive Design:**
        Ensure that your expense tracker is responsive and looks good on various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

12. [ ] **Error Handling:**
        Implement error handling for cases such as submitting incomplete forms, failed data fetches, or any other potential issues.

13. [ ] **Undo/Redo Functionality (Optional):**
        If you're feeling adventurous, you can implement undo/redo functionality to allow users to revert or redo changes made to their expense entries.

Start with the basic features and gradually add more complexity as you become more comfortable with React. This project will not only help you learn React but also understand state management, form handling, and data manipulation in a real-world context.
